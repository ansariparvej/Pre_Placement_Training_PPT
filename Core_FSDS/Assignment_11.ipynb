They analyze the surrounding words or sentences and learn to assign similar vectors to words that often occur in similar contexts.

    "The transformer architecture offers several advantages over traditional RNN-based models in text processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parallelization: Transformers process the entire input sequence simultaneously, enabling efficient parallel computation. In contrast, RNNs process sequences sequentially, limiting parallelization and resulting in slower training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Long-range Dependencies: The self-attention mechanism in transformers allows capturing long-range dependencies effectively. RNNs, on the other hand, suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it challenging for them to capture dependencies beyond a few time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Contextual Information: Transformers can incorporate contextual information from the entire input sequence through self-attention, enabling them to make more informed predictions or generate coherent outputs. RNNs maintain limited context in their hidden states, which may result in a loss of important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Global Information: Transformers have a global view of the input sequence, as each position attends to all other positions. This global information helps in understanding the overall structure and meaning of the text. RNNs, in contrast, have a local view and rely on information propagated from previous time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalability: Transformers can handle input sequences of variable lengths without the need for padding or truncation. RNNs, however, require fixed-length inputs, which may result in information loss or unnecessary computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Pretrained Models: Transformers have been successfully pretrained on large-scale corpora, enabling transfer learning and fine-tuning on specific tasks. Pretrained RNN-based models are less prevalent, limiting the availability of general-purpose models.\n",
